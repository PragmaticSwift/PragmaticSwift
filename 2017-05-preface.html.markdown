# Preface

Welcome to Pragmatic Swift, this is the first and pilot issue. The goal of this publication is to gather articles about trending topics related to the Swift programming language. Pragmatic Swift is heavily inspired by [Objc.io's issues](https://www.objc.io/issues/), trying to open as much as possible the possibility to help and contribute to the project.

## Why

Swift is a young programming language and for this reason it's difficult to find a good and reliable source of publications and articles. The current state of the art is composed by single blogs maintained by great developers devoted to share as much as possible and great newsletters to help everybody else in staying informed about where to find these articles.

The fragmentation of sources makes stay informed about the current status of Swift very hard, the pace of the language itself is high and every year there are new features and small details changed. Details that can make a big difference if learned, but that sometimes are hidden or not so easy to master in a first usage. 

Swift is a programming language is in rapid evolution, the nature of the language is gaining traction also in other usages outside the Apple ecosystem.

## The concept

The original concept has been discussed during the first edition of [Swift Alps](http://swiftalps.com) and with the support of many people, the whole process got shaped in a very natural way. The main 3 goals were to be: technical, structured and open to the community. Run a project like this fully open might be a big risk and a journey full of pitfalls, but the outcome can definitely pay off. So you might ask, how this works? Well, let me explain it in details...

### The process

The whole process is about having an author and an editor for each article. The author writes the article helped by an editor that checks for mistakes and validates the whole idea behind the article, giving feedbacks, opinions and eventually fixing typos or grammar when necessary.

Every issue aims to have between 4 and 5 articles, for the first part it will be a bimonthly publication, to better fix the problems behind the process and find contributors. If everything works correctly, the plan is to switch to a monthly issue by Fall 2017.

### Continuation

Once an issue is ready, the editors can decide to fade away and authors are kindly asked to become editors on the following release helping the new ones in writing the article for the following issue. This creates a continuation in the project and gives the opportunity to share what the editor, previously author, learned during the process. If an editor wants to help on the following release, he's more than welcome, the only restriction is that an author should avoid to write an article in two consecutive issues.

### Effort

As previously said, an author is asked to be editor in the following release, for this reason the required effort should not be underestimated. The number of hours required vary from 4 up to 10 hours for a single article, depending on the level of experience, knowledge of the topic and also interest. The more an author is interested, the more an article is detailed, but this can also make the whole process longer than expected. If you want to help, please take this under consideration.

### Topics

For the first issues, the general topics are already decided and won't have much room for being discussed, but starting from Fall 2017, the goal is to open the decision about the topic and also the selection of authors, trying to give to everyone the chance to participate, share and learn.

### Type of Articles

Pragmatic Swift aims to give detailed posts and insights on specific topics, trying to be technical and informative. There's no reason to create tutorials or how-to articles, these kind of resources have a couple of great sources like [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) and [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com), their value is already known and widely recognized.

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading the preface, there's no need to annoy you more, I conclude with an amazing quote:

> Everybody [...] should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think. - Steve Jobs

hoping that you will enjoy this project.
